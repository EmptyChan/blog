### Plot
As the office worker Kobayashi gets ready for work, she is greeted by a large dragon staring into her eyes from across the balcony. The dragon immediately transforms into a young humanoid in a maid outfit, and introduces herself as Tohru. It turns out that during a drunken excursion to the mountains the day before, Kobayashi had encountered the dragon, who claims to have come from another world. Having no place to stay, Kobayashi had offered to let the dragon stay at her home; Tohru decided to repay her kindness by working as her personal maid. Despite initial reluctance, a mix of guilt and Tohru's dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to accept her. Despite being efficient at housework, Tohru's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up scaring Kobayashi and bringing more trouble than help. Additionally, Tohru's presence attracts other mythical beings to her new home.
